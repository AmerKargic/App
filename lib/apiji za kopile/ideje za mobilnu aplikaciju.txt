Great question! Warehouse workers (skladištari) deal with speed, accuracy, and “where the hell is this thing?” problems all day.
**Here are real-world, research-backed feature ideas for your warehouse/stockroom app**—going well beyond basic barcode scanning and shelf location. These come from warehouse management best practices, Reddit warehouse worker threads, and warehouse software reviews.

# **Practical Features Warehouse Workers Love (Beyond Basic Scanning)**

---

### **1. Fast “Putaway” Mode**

* **Workflow:** When new goods arrive, worker scans *location* (shelf/rack/pallet QR), then scans every item going there.
* **Why:** This means everything is tracked “as it’s shelved,” not later, so stock is always accurate.

---

### **2. Pick List / Order Picking (Paperless)**

* **Workflow:** Worker gets a digital list of orders to pick.
* **App guides them**: “Go to Aisle 5, Shelf 2, pick 4x Item X. Scan each as you go.”
* **Why:** Reduces mistakes and makes picking much faster—especially for new staff.

---

### **3. Quick Stock Adjust (Shrinkage/Damage/Returns)**

* **Workflow:** Scan product, mark as “damaged,” “lost,” or “returned.”
* **Why:** You keep real inventory, spot patterns (e.g., if lots of damage in one area).

---

### **4. Real-Time Stock Level Checks**

* **Workflow:** Scan any shelf/location, instantly see what *should* be there.
* **Bonus:** Mark items as missing/found if mismatched.
* **Why:** Prevents “phantom stock” and lets you do rolling/cycle counts anytime.

---

### **5. Fast Transfer Between Locations**

* **Workflow:** Scan item, “Move,” scan new location.
* **Why:** Items get moved for promos, repairs, etc.—this keeps DB correct.

---

### **6. Receive by PO or Invoice**

* **Workflow:** Scan/enter purchase order or invoice code, then scan items as received.
* **Why:** Confirms supplier sent the right stuff and flags any missing items.

---

### **7. Real-Time “Shortage” Alerts**

* **Workflow:** If picking/putaway shows stock below min, worker is alerted immediately.
* **Why:** Fix out-of-stock BEFORE it becomes a sales problem.

---

### **8. Batch/Expiry Management**

* **Workflow:** When scanning, optionally enter batch number or expiry date (for food/pharma).
* **Why:** Track soon-to-expire, auto-warn when picking, or for recalls.

---

### **9. Task/Work Assignment Board**

* **Workflow:** List of tasks assigned per worker/shift: “Restock aisle 2,” “Cycle count area 3,” “Clean up dock.”
* **Why:** No confusion about what to do next, less running to the office for paper lists.

---

### **10. Problem Reporting (with Photo Upload)**

* **Workflow:** Scan product or location, take a photo, leave note (“Damaged shelf”, “Spilled product”).
* **Why:** Quick reporting; manager gets notified, problem is documented.

---

### **11. Replenishment Guidance**

* **Workflow:** Show which locations need refilling, generate a “replenishment run” (move stock from back to front).
* **Why:** Sales floor never runs out of popular items.

---

### **12. “Where Is It?” Advanced Search**

* **Workflow:** Search by part of the name, description, or even supplier.
* **Why:** Sometimes barcode is missing, but worker knows what they’re looking for.

---

### **13. Multiple Units of Measure**

* **Workflow:** App shows if item is tracked by box, case, pallet, piece.
* **Why:** Avoids errors when scanning and updating counts.

---

### **14. Outbound/Shipping Scan**

* **Workflow:** Scan products as they leave warehouse (for stores, customers, or transfers).
* **Why:** Inventory always reflects real outgoing stock.

---

### **15. Barcode Reprint**

* **Workflow:** If a label is damaged, worker can tap “Reprint barcode” from product screen.
* **Why:** Keeps everything scannable, no “missing barcode” excuses.

---

## **BONUS: Usability Features**

* **Offline Mode:** So they can keep working if WiFi goes out.
* **Big Buttons/Font:** For gloves, and in cold/dusty conditions.
* **Sound/Color Feedback:** “Beep” or green flash when scan is good, red/alert if error.

---

## **Workflow Example: “Cycle Count” (Rolling Inventory Audit)**

* Worker opens “Cycle Count” mode
* App shows which area to count today
* Worker scans location, then all items on that shelf/pallet
* App instantly flags any mismatches or missing items
* Supervisor gets instant report
